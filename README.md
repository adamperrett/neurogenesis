# Error Driven Neurogenesis (EDN)

As of writing the most up to date branch is *simple_attention*. This code has been branched many times to work across multiple projects and has not been brought back to master faithfully. Many of the datasets are not included due to the limit of data size on github.

For any enquiries about the structure/function or application of the code please contact me at adamperrett3142@gmail.com
